### pre-production capstone, resource dump

Attempting to setup a skeleton/framework for capstone project based on marketing analytics wrt video games
potential road-block: most (or probably all) of the data wrt production costs are private or behind some paywall, so getting round that by looking at publicly available 
sales data and inferring trends from extended history and recent history wrt genre/platform etc.
Average marketing budget for AAA game is about the same as development cost – ads/social media hype/tv-spots/events; for indie/mobile roughly half to same

main question: Where the video game industry is headed based on sales and review trends across platforms and emerging technologies? (maybe how pandemic has influenced it too) 
platforms will be the most popular ones on the markets: consoles, pc, mobile etc.
emerging tech - vr/ar etc. 

- Look at global sales for n years – extended and recent
- Look at review trends for n top/bottom performers
- Look at popularity trends (twitch) to see how influencers are affecting the market or vice-versa
- AAA games vs. mobile vs. indie

How to get data?
API – steam? Etc.
Scraper – sales data/reviews from Wikipedia and vgchartz
premade datasets from kaggle
